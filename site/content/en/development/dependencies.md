    Prerequisite for using AzureDisk CSI Driver.
---

### Prerequisite
 - The driver depends on [cloud provider config file](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-azure/blob/master/docs/cloud-provider-config.md), usually it's `/etc/kubernetes/azure.json` on all kubernetes nodes deployed by [AKS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/) or [aks-engine](https://github.com/Azure/aks-engine), here is [azure.json example](./deploy/example/azure.json).
 > To specify a different cloud provider config file, create `azure-cred-file` configmap before driver installation, e.g. for OpenShift, it's `/etc/kubernetes/cloud.conf` (make sure config file path is in the `volumeMounts.mountPath`)
 > ```console
 > kubectl create configmap azure-cred-file --from-literal=path="/etc/kubernetes/cloud.conf" --from-literal=path-windows="C:\\k\\cloud.conf" -n kube-system
 > ```
 - This driver also supports [read cloud config from kuberenetes secret](./docs/read-from-secret.md).
 - If cluster identity is [Managed Service Identity(MSI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-managed-identity), make sure user assigned identity has `Contributor` role on node resource group
